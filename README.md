# AutoDiscJax

The `autodiscjax` is a python software built upon `jax`, that allows to perform automated discovery
and exploration of complex systems.

In particular, we use it to organize the exploration of computational models of 
biological processes (such as gene, proteins or metabolites networks) using
curiosity-driven learning and exploration algorithms.
